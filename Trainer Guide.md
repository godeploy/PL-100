# Trainer Guide

## Environments

Students will need one Common Data Service (CDS) environment each to complete the course work. Environments can be provisioned as trial environments by the students during class or they can be provisioned prior to the delivery with credentials handed over to the students prior to the first exercise.

The environments need no specific configuration considerations, a plain CDS *without any sample data* is all that is needed.

## Course Flow

PL-100 is broken down into two different delivery formats.

  - Days 1 & 2: PowerPoint presentations, instructor led demos, quick hands-on-labs.

  - Day 3: Scenario driven hands on labs.

### Day 1 and 2

Most of the content delivered on days 1 and 2 is based on the content available on Microsoft Learn. Some topics that don’t currently have a lot of coverage on Microsoft Learn have had some additional slides added to fill in any gaps. Microsoft Learn labs are sprinkled in throughout both days to act as a supplement PPT decks and instructor led demonstrations.

The PowerPoint decks specifically callout when to have the students do the hands-on-labs and which ones to have them do. Some of the Microsoft Learn labs build off each other, and some of them are stand alone, it is a good Idea to familiarize yourself with the Microsoft Learn labs. This will also help you determine which ones could be skipped during class time in the even that you are falling behind.

### Day 3

Day 3 is a full day of hands-on-labs where students will be building a company 311 solutions. At the beginning of the day, you will present the students with the solution and talk about some of the key elements in the lab. Since students will be working on labs all day, you should check back with them periodically to keep them engaged. After each lab is completed, check back, and talk about some of the discussion points related to that lab as well as introduce the tasks and expectations for the next lab.

It is highly recommended that you walk through and complete the complete list of Day 3 labs as a student prior to the training delivery.

  - Familiarity with the exercises will make the delivery more efficient.

  - Solution components built during this exercise can be used as needed for your demos. While demos are not required, they are a very effective delivery tool and will provide students a visual change from just listening to power points. You should plan to do as many as you feel comfortable with on the topics you know best.

## Days 1 & 2 Agenda

Below you will find a general agenda outline that you can use while delivering. The timings on the agenda are estimates based on the content that is being presented. Your actual delivery time may vary depending on your audience, questions, delivery style, etc. The estimated times include any instructor led demonstrations as well as any Microsoft Learn practice exercises students will be doing.

## Day 3 Hands on Labs Overview

Below, you will find the scenario that students will be walking through as part of day three. Make sure that you have taken time to be familiar with the scenario.

### Scenario

You are an employee at Lamna Healthcare Company and work in the billing department. 

As you were walking out to your car from work you noticed the company digital sign by the exit was still welcoming participants of the 2019 convention.  You would tell someone, but you have no idea who to tell.  So often you find something in your company that should be fixed but have no way to tell anyone. 

 As you were driving home sitting in traffic you had an idea. What if there was an app you could use to report things like this.  You could report a location, a category and even a picture of the problem so someone could easily locate and fix it.  The only problem was if you got people to report things who would be listening. 

The next day at work you met with your friend in the facility department and shared your idea.  She was excited too because today there is no coordinated way, she can get problems like these reported and fixed. She explained how often they involve different departments and must be routed and followed up to find out the status.  She had looked at commercial options, but they had been too complex and inflexible, overengineered, and expensive. She did however give you an example of a 311-system used by cities for their citizens to report problems.  Based on that example, you decided you would call it Company 311

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The intent hands-on-labs on day three is to help the students to better understand how to build a complete solution using the Power Platform. They will be building components typical for Power Platform solutions. There will be dependencies. Students will need to perform the labs in order to ensure any required components are available moving forward. Labs two and three will involve importing solutions. Sample data imported during the lab makes building and testing the apps easier, more realistic, and more relatable.

Trainers should clearly explain the objective of every lab and outline high-level solution components and techniques. Students then should be encouraged to design and build their own solutions without following step by step instructions for every exercise.

### Microsoft Teams

The world has changed rapidly in the recent months and organizations need tools to work collaboratively yet remotely.  Microsoft Teams provides a powerful platform for collaboration and communication, and also provides an app maker with additional options when deploying apps and building business processes.  Consider ways some of your business apps and processes could be elevated by integrating with Microsoft Teams. 

To help students better understand Microsoft Teams as a communication and collaboration mechanism, some of the labs include additional exercises highlighting integration of the Power Platform components in Microsoft Teams.

### Components

Completed components are available for *all* exercises. They include canvas apps, model-driven app, power automation flows, Power BI pbix file, sample data and data import map, and complete solution exported as both managed and unmanaged. Components shouldn’t be used as a shortcut to exercise completion. Instead, they are useful as a demo tool and as a general point of reference.

## Labs

### Lab 01 Design the Solution

Application designers need to be able to take requirements, requests, wants, and needs and turn them into a tangible solution. Based on requirements gathering, app designers should be able to identify gaps and requirements for specific ideas. They should be able to map requirements to the Power Platform and determine what is needed for a data model. Clearly defining requirements and building a solid data model is a foundation of the apps built on the platform. In this lab, students gather requirements from interviews, and and other artifacts. They will be walked through how to create a data model to support the requirements and import sample data.

Topics to discuss:

  - What tools would you use?

  - How do you approach modeling?

  - Where do you start?

  - Relationships

  - Good practices around implementing data model in CDS

  - Bringing Common Data Model entities (e.g. contacts) – what to include.

  - Dev/test sample data sets – how much is enough. Good practices around building dev/test data sets.

### Lab 02 Data model and model-driven app

In this lab students will be implementing the data model that was discussed in the previous lab. In addition, they will be model-driven app that will be used by anyone fixing problems or managing the overall effort. This is the not application that would be used to report the problem. That is a canvas app that will be built in the next lab.

#### Topics you can discuss

  - Model-driven apps as part of a solution

  - Model-driven vs canvas Power Apps. Target audience and app objectives.

  - What makes a good sitemap?

  - What to include into an app for a given entity?

  - Apps & roles, security in CDS, UI trimming in model-driven apps

  - Adjusting data model vs adjusting the model-driven app

#### Things to watch out for:

Some students may have questions on the creation of entities. Make sure to encourage students to read the complete instructions and not just focus on the pictures. Focusing on the images only may result in missing a step that will be important later.

Some students may struggle with importing the demo data solution. Make sure you have walked through it a couple of times to ensure you can easily field any questions that they might have.

### Lab 03 Canvas app

This lab has the students building the canvas application that employees will be able to use to report issues they encounter. The canvas app will include a screen that displays reported issues, and a screen where users can report issues. The hand-on-lab consists of three exercises.

  - Exercise 1: Import Company Components – Students will import a SharedComponents solution that includes some prebuilt components that they will use for the header and footer of the app.

  - Exercise 2: Create App and Layout – Students will create the main and issue reporting screens. They will use Galleries and Forms to control how people interact with the app.

  - Exercise 3: Submit a new report – Students will use the canvas app that they created to report a new issue and test the functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Students will need to have completed all the exercises in Lab 2 prior to working on this lab.

#### Topics to discuss

  - Tablet vs phone form factor. Responsive layouts (available soon in canvas).

  - How does the target audience impact the app design.

  - How knowledge of Excel can benefit app makers (traditional procedural programming vs properties and expression syntax of Power Apps)

  - Which connector to use. How CDS connector is now internal to canvas Power Apps.

  - App checker – new metrics every day. Make sure to retest the app.

  - Accessibility – what makes a good accessible app

#### Things to watch out for

##### Component Library Issue

At the time the course was created, there was a glitch with imported components libraries from solutions not showing up as component libraries. The lab was modified to include instructions for opening the app that includes the components and saving it with a slightly different name. This will ensure that it saves as a component library and that they can be added correctly to the app.

##### Formula Error

In Exercise 1 \> Task 3 \> Step 20 students are instructed to copy and paste a formula into the canvas apps OnStart event. If students are copying and pasting the text from a PDF or Markdown, they might encounter the text not populating correctly. Many of the Double Quotes items such as Label and Icon could be replaced with single quotes. This will cause the formula to error out.

Some students may struggle with importing the components library solution. Make sure you have walked through it a couple of times to ensure you can easily field any questions that they might have.

### Lab 04 Business Process Flows and Business Rules

In this lab, students will create a Business Process Flow that can be used to help guide responsible parties in resolving any issues reported. Students will also create a Business Rule that prevents closing the Reported item if no resolution is provided.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Students need to complete the exercises in Lab 02 prior to working on this lab. The business rules and business process flows build on the items data model created in Lab 02.

#### Topics to discuss

  - How else might Business Rules be leveraged as part of this process.

  - What if you did not want to start the business process with a Reported item? What if you wanted to make more generic?

  - Scope: Talk through how scope of a business rule can impact which rule you choose and how it is interacted with by users.

#### Things to watch out for

This lab does not have any real issues that come up. The biggest issue is this lab would be if people had not completed all the necessary steps in the previous labs.

### Lab 05 Power Automate

In this lab, students will use Power Automate flows to automate various parts of the Company 311 solution.  The following have been identified as requirements you must implement to complete the project: 

- Escalation, approval, and execution process for urgent maintenance issues 

- Notify reporting user about the issue status changes 

- How to use a business rule to implement logic.

Keeping in mind the requirements above, students will add additional fields that will be used to support the desired automation. Students will leverage both the CDS connector and approvals to handle the escalation of items as needed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Students need to complete the exercises in both Lab 02 and Lab 04 prior to working on this lab. The approval flows that you will be creating build on the data model created in lab 02 and the additional fields added in lab 04.

#### Topics to discuss

  - Flows in solutions
  - CDS connectors (standard vs current environment)
  - Other automation means in Power Platform (real-time workflow, UI automation)
  - Human interaction with flows - approval processes
  - Using adaptive cards instead of approval emails
  - Testing the processes during the build
  - Sharing the flows
  - Monitoring running processes

#### Items to watch out for

Adding **Wait for an approval** action sometimes generates the following error message: 

> Http request failed with unhandled exception of type 'NullReferenceException' and message: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'.

This message can be ignored. 

There are no any other real issues that occur during this lab. The biggest item is that students begin to drift a little towards the end of exercise three. Many of the steps are similar and start to run together.

### Lab 06 Power BI

In this lab, students will build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes data related to reporting items. Students will use Power BI desktop to build a dashboard and report elements that can be viewed in Power BI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Students need to complete the exercises in Lab 02 prior to working on this lab. The visual elements that they will create in this lab, use the data model created in lab 02.

#### Topics to discuss

  - Who is the target audience of the report?

  - How will the audience consume the report? Typical device? Location?

  - How to start the design; how to move beyond the blank canvas

  - Connect to data sources, build and refine data model

  - Do you have sufficient data to visualize?

  - What are the possible characteristics you can use to analyze data about the visits?

  - Publishing and sharing the reports

  - Accessibility in Power BI when building interactive reports

#### Items to watch out for

Students will need to have Power BI desktop installed on their local machine to build data sets and transform data. Students that do not have Power BI Desktop installed should download it from the Microsoft downloads page: [https://aka.ms/pbiSingleInstaller](https://aka.ms/pbiSingleInstaller).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While students can install it from the Windows Store, it is not recommended to have them install from there. They will likely receive permission errors.

Some students may not be able to download the application at all because of permission restrictions on their machine. In those instances, the .pbix file that students create is included. Students can load that into Power BI and build the report in Power BI service ([https://app.powerbi.com](https://app.powerbi.com)). These steps are outlined in **Exercise 5**.

### Lab 07 Model-driven app

In this lab students will learn how to deploy solutions to another environment. This lab lets students better understand additional item they should consider when designing application and deploying them, such as security, compatibility testing.

#### Topics to discuss

  - Who should be able to access the different apps?

  - Model-driven vs canvas Power Apps. (How do you control access?)

  - Where are you deploying the applications to?

  - Apps & roles, security in CDS, UI trimming in model-driven apps
